# MHS InSite: Privacy Policy

Welcome to privacy policy for the MHS InSite for Android! It is a very unintrusive app, and thus this will be a very short policy to go over.

# Data collected by the app
The app is not programed to collect any data from the users.

# Explanation of permissions requested by the app
The app only request two permissions from the user: android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION and android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.
Both are used to show where the user is in relation to historic site in the following two ways: 
  1) To display the users' location on a Google Map.
  2) To calculate the distance between the user and the selected historic site.
The user location is not stored or collected into any external databases, and is cleared by simply closing the app.


If you find any security vulnerabilies, or have any questions about how the app protects your privacy, please send us an email.
